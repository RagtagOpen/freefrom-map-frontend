      <b>Alternatives to law enforcement responses</b> refers to responses
      without police, law enforcement or a carceral system (a system that
      includes prison or jail). Survivor experience and research shows that
      involving law enforcement in intimate partner violence cases can be more
      harmful and devastating for survivors. Read{" "}

      . Alternative responses to law-enforcement and incarceration as used in
      the Policy Map and Scorecard refers to alternative approaches and
      responses to intimate partner violence that do not rely solely on police,
      law enforcement, or incarceration.

      <b>Coerced and fraudulent debt</b> (which 52% of survivors experience)
      occurs when a harm-doer uses coercion or fraud to access credit in the
      survivor’s name. Some examples include a harm-doer applying for a credit
      card and incurring debt in the survivor’s name without their knowledge or
      threatening a survivor with violence unless they sign a credit card
      application.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Economic abuse</b> (which is prevalent in 99% of intimate partner
      violence cases) occurs when a harm-doer exerts control over a survivor’s
      ability to acquire, use, and / or maintain economic resources. Harm-doers
      use a range of economic abuse tactics. These include putting a survivor on
      a strict allowance and/or demanding receipts for all purchases made,
      monitoring online bank accounts, forcing a survivor to quit a job or
      preventing them from going to work, requiring them to hand over their
      paychecks, and incurring debt via credit cards or loans in a survivor’s
      name without their knowledge or consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Harm-Doer</b> refers to someone who has caused harm to another. We
      understand the complexity of intimate partner violence and that harm-doers
      or people who cause harm are often survivors themselves. We use harm-doer
      instead of perpetrator or abuser to acknowledge their ability to heal and
      not be indefinitely defined by their actions as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Litigation abuse</b> occurs when a harm-doer misuses the legal system
      to assert power and control over a survivor, including by doing things in
      court or through their attorney to increase a survivor’s legal fees. Some
      examples include: filing multiple groundless motions to increase costs for
      the survivor, serving irrelevant and / or harassing discovery requests on
      the survivor (e.g., “identify all of your sexual partners”) and asking for
      unnecessary hearings to force the survivor to appear in court and miss
      work / find affordable child care.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>“No Drop Policy”</b> refers to a policy that gives the state prosecutor
      the sole authority to decide whether or not to prosecute a harm-doer for
      intimate partner violence in criminal court, whether or not the survivor
      wants to press charges or take the case to trial. Under a “no drop
      policy”, a survivor has no say in how the state will proceed with a
      criminal case against their harm-doer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Reasonable accommodations</b> are any changes to a job, the way a job
      is done, or the work environment made by an employer to ensure the safety
      of a survivor while at work. Examples of reasonable accommodations
      include, but not limited to the ability to work from home, a modified or
      flexible schedule, and transfer to another work facility.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Special considerations for public benefits</b> exempt or defer certain
      applicants from some program requirements and / or speed up their
      applications. For example, under certain circumstances, a survivor’s
      application for a public benefit may be considered more quickly or they
      may be exempted from applicable work requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Survivor wealth</b> refers to a state of abundance and thriving where
      survivors have sustaining income, savings, and credit with which to build
      wealth and the resources to support individual, intergenerational, and
      community healing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Torts</b> describe what happens when one person injures another. For
      example, assault, battery, and the intentional infliction of emotional
      distress are all torts. Tort law allows the person who was injured to sue
      the person who caused the injury in court to recover some of the costs the
      injury caused. Some examples of costs that can be covered in a tort case
      include medical bills, damaged property, mental health costs, and
      attorneys’ fees.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Continuing tort</b> refers to torts that continues or repeats over time
      as one single tort rather than multiple torts. When a tort is a continuing
      tort, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the last in
      the series of the torts occurs.
