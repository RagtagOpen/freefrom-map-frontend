# Freefrom Map Front-end

This is a modified version of [this code](http://bl.ocks.org/michellechandra/0b2ce4923dc9b5809922) which itself was taken from a few different examples.

## Getting Started

To install:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add a valid value for `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
