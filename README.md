# Freefrom Map Front-end
This is the Freefrom Map front-end. It will consist of the following apps:

1. Visual tool for users to find states
1. CMS for administrators to control states

# Structure
The admin CMS is under the `admin` directory which is a React application. To start that application, follow the `README`
instructions within the folder.

The user facing map is under the `client` directory, which is a NextJS application. To start the front end application,
follow the `README` within that folder.
